1) Resetting the desktop ID

This method consists in generating a new AnyDesk ID, which allows you to bypass AnyDesk restrictions.
It uses a script that deletes certain files and folders in the following paths: C:\ProgramData\AnyDesk and C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\AnyDesk.
This retains the ad.roster.items variable to keep the connection history but reset the desktop ID.

2) Using an older version of AnyDesk

AnyDesk 6.0.8 version has no restrictions on free usage as it does not require a paid subscription.
You can download it from the official website via Web Archive: [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200903224422/https://anydesk.com/en/downloads/windows), or use our repository.
